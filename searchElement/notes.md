<p>If we combine all the "O" operations it becomes <strong>O(n^2 +2)</strong></p>
<p><strong>O(n^2)</strong> is a dominant term</p>
<p>"n" is Non-Dominant term</p>
<p>So we remove the "non-dominant" term and we're only left with O(n^2)</p>
<p>This way, we simplify our bigO</p>

<!-- O(log n) -->
<p><strong>O(log n)</strong> time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime that grows logarithmically with the size of the input <br> (represented by n). In simpler terms, as the input size increases, the time it takes for <br>the algorithm to run increases slowly.</p>
